#The main goal of this case study is serve as an excercise in coding and statistical knowledge. 
    #No R packages or any functions beyond base R's scope were utilized.
    #Several of R's existing functions may have been re-derived to allow the researcher to explore a deeper understanding of the given concepts and their theoritical implications


    #The study attempts to fit a linear model for the given data set and to also derive conclusions on various estimated population parameters
    #Population parameters will estimated via the empirical and via samples obtain through bootstrapping

    #The set used is a real data set of user submitted reviews of several medications posted by individuals from xxxx to yyyy to webmd.com 
    #The data set was harvested from webmd.com and posted to () by user
    #The initial clean of the file was obtained from kaggle.com( ), posted and clenaed by user
    #Further cleaning of the file is documented and explained in the comments of the runfile

    #The variables in the data set are as follows:

    # 


    #Variables added for this purposes of this study:



    #TotalUserScore was considered the only response variable

    #A full proposed linear model of with all interaction terms would be:
    #

    #The study initially considers all factors in the model but will narrow its findings down to a sigular factor's interaction with the data

    #This iteration of the study will attempt to fit the following linear model:
    # Y = 

    #^1The lack of interactions in this model is intentional and was done to keep computations fairly simple. 
    #The severe impact this decision has on the accuracy of the results of the study should go into consideration if any actionable conclusion were to be derived from the study.
